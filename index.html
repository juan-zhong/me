            <p>
              Hi, I'm a second-year PhD student in linguistics at <a href="https://arts-sciences.buffalo.edu/linguistics.html">University at Buffalo</a> and a member of the fieldwork group at UB.
                Prior to UB, I obtained my bachelor's degree in Teaching Chinese to Speakers of Other Languages from <a href="https://en.bfsu.edu.cn"> Beijing Foreign Studies University</a> and my master's degree in East Asian Languages and Cultures from <a href="http://ealac.columbia.edu"> Columbia University</a>.
                My research interests include morphosyntax, pragmatics, and language documentation,
                In my free time, I enjoy cooking and painting.
                Here is my <a href="/me/CV_JZ_20240918.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a>. 
            </p>
        </section>

            <h2>Research</h2>
         <h3>Morphosyntax</h3>
            <p>
             I am interested in how complex compounding provides a lens for understanding the boundary between morphology and syntax. Currently I am working on a formal analysis of the internal structure of dish names across languages under the supervision of <a href="https://www.jeanpierrekoenig.com" target="_blank">Jean-Pierre Koenig</a> for my Qualifying Paper.
             </p>

                     <h3>Discourse Pragmatics</h3>
            <p> My work in this area centers around how participants highlight focus in updating discourses. Languages being investigated include different Chinese dialects, Yucatec Maya, and Bimoba.
             </p>

        
        <h3>Emotion, Odor, and Language</h3>
                         <p>
             Recently, I have been wondering how emotions and odors as experience-based constructs are produced and reproduced by language cross-culturally. 
                             To what extent are languages infused with emotions? How are the lingusitic expressions of emotions related to the speaker or the event agent?
                             For example, are the affective suffixes attested in Quechua and Aymara (South Bolivian varieties) subject-oriented, speaker-oriented, or neither?
                             How do human conceptualize their experiences with odors and what role does language play in such process? 
                          </p>

              <h3>Language Documentation</h3>
                         <p>
             I was born and raised in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anyuan_County" target="_blank">Anyuan</a>, China, and I speak Anyuan Hakka, a lesser-studied variety of the Hakka language. Since 2021, I have initiated an ongoing Hakka documenttaion project, in which I collaborate with local community members to document, analyze, preserve, and promote the language.
                          </p>
            
         <h3>Other Research Areas</h3>
           <p>
             Previously, I have worked on language pedagogy and Second Language Acquisition.
            </p>
