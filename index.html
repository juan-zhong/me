        <section id="about" class="content-section">
            <p>
              I'm a second-year PhD student in linguistics at <a href="https://arts-sciences.buffalo.edu/linguistics.html">University at Buffalo</a>, advised by <a href="https://www.jeanpierrekoenig.com" target="_blank">Jean-Pierre Koenig</a>.
                I'm also a member of the fieldwork group at UB. 
                I obtained my BA in Teaching Chinese to Speakers of Other Languages from <a href="https://en.bfsu.edu.cn"> Beijing Foreign Studies University</a> and my MA in East Asian Languages and Cultures from <a href="http://ealac.columbia.edu"> Columbia University</a>.
                My research interests center around morphosyntax, discourse pragmatics, and language documentation. Languages I have worked on include Hakka, Balti, Bimoba, Quechua, and Aymara. 
                Outside of linguistics, I cook, paint, and photograph for fun.
                Here is my <a href="/me/CV_JZ_20240918.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a>.

            <h2>Research</h2>
         <h3>Complex Compound</h3>
            <p>
             Complex compounds (compounds consisting of three or more members) provide a lens for understanding the boundary between morphology and syntax. What is a word? What is a phrase? When we form words out of multiple words, what is the limit? My current project investigates the structure of complex compound nouns using Mandarcin dish names dataset. 
             </p>

                     <h3>Information Structure</h3>
            <p> My work in this area centers around how interlocutors highlight focal information in discourse. Languages being investigated include different Chinese dialects, Yucatec Maya, and Bimoba.
             </p>

        
        <h3>Emotionality</h3>
                         <p>
             Recently, I have been thinking how emotions, feelings, affections, or sentiments, shape and are shaped by language use cross-culturally.
                             How are emotionality expressed across-lingusitically? How do the lingusitic expressions of emotionality related to the interlocutors' experience, knowledge, and attention?
                             For example, are the affective suffixes attested in Quechua and Aymara (South Bolivian varieties) subject-oriented, speaker-oriented, or something else?
             </p>

              <h3>Language Documentation</h3>
                         <p>
             I was born and raised in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anyuan_County" target="_blank">Anyuan</a>, China, and I speak Anyuan Hakka, a lesser-studied variety of the Hakka language. 
                             Since 2021, I have initiated an ongoing Hakka documenttaion project, in which I collaborate with local community members to document, analyze, preserve, and promote the language. 
                             For example, in 2024 I have developed an introductory course of general lingusitics and taught it in Anyuan Hakka to a group of community members who have no prior lingusitics background. 
                             The course provided easy access to linguistic knowledge for local community memebers who do not speak English (or Mandarin) and equipped them with basic lingusitic tools to better understand Anyuan Hakka, their own everyday language. 
            I also run an Anyuan Hakka online chatting group with young generations from Anyuan. 
                             The chatting group meets biweekly online, which creates a vibrant space for people who are from Anyuan but have (im)migrated to other places for study or work to continiously speak Anyuan Hakka and maintain their proficiency.
                          </p>
            
         <h3>Other Research Areas</h3>
           <p>
             Previously, I worked on language pedagogy and Second Language Acquisition.
