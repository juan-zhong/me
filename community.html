        <h2>Community program for students from underdeveloped counties 县城学子互助计划</h2>
          <p> In 2020, I collebrated with a group of friends from Anyuan and initiated a community-based program to share our experiences and perspectives with younger Anyuan people in high schools and colleges. The vision of this program is to foster a community where peers from underdeveloped towns in China help each other. We run a mentoring for growth plan (CTHH) twice a year (every summer and winter break) and a drop-in chatting room (OHOH) weekly during fall semesters. </p>
          <p> In CTHH, people voluntarily sign up as mentors and mentees and are grouped into pairs based on shared backgrounds and interests. Each pair has a 60-90 minute online conversation where the mentor shares their individual experiences and stories with the mentee who have questions regarding study, work, or life. </p> 
          <p> In OHOH, members from the CTHH plan freely join in the weekly online chatting room hosted by a regular mentor and have conversations about their questionsa and interests. </p>
          <p> By 2025, we have run 11 cycles of CTHH (2020-2025) and three cycles of OHOH (2022-2025), In addition, We also organized two special summer gatherings (2022 & 2023) where we had theme-based dicussions by community members and talks by invited guests.</p>
