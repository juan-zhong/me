        <h2>Community program for students from underdeveloped counties 县城学子互助计划</h2>
          <p> In 2020, I collaborated with peers from Anyuan to establish a community-based program dedicated to helping young people from underdeveloped counties in China. The program aims to foster a supportive peer network where members share experiences, exchange perspectives, and empower one another through mutual learning and mentorship. We operate two main initiatives: the Mentoring for Growth (CTHH) plan, held twice annually during summer and winter breaks, and the Drop-in Chat Room (OHOH), held weekly during the fall semester. </p>
          <p> In CTHH, people voluntarily sign up as mentors or mentees and are matched in pairs based on shared backgrounds and interests. Each pair engages in a 60–90 minute online conversation, during which mentors share personal stories and advice, while mentees bring questions about study, work, or life.</p> 
          <p> In OHOH, members from the CTHH plan freely join in the weekly online chatting room hosted by regular mentors and have conversations about their questionsa and interests in an informal, supportive environment. </p>
          <p> By 2025, we have successfully completed 11 rounds of CTHH (2020–2025) and three rounds of OHOH (2022–2025). Additionally, we organized two special summer gatherings (2022 and 2023) featuring thematic discussions and invited guest talks that strengthened community engagement.</p>
